# Kideny-Disease-Classification

Kidney cysts are round pouches of fluid that form on or in the kidneys. Kidney cysts can occur with disorders that may impair kidney function. But more often, kidney cysts are a type called simple kidney cysts. Simple kidney cysts aren't cancer and rarely cause problems

Kidney stones (also called renal calculi, nephrolithiasis or urolithiasis) are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside your kidneys. Diet, excess body weight, some medical conditions, and certain supplements and medications are among the many causes of kidney stones

Kidney tumors (also called renal tumors) are growths in the kidneys that can be benign or cancerous. Most do not cause symptoms and are discovered unexpectedly when you are being diagnosed and treated for another condition.
